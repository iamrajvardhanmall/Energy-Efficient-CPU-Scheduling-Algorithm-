# Energy-Efficient-CPU-Scheduling-Algorithm-

1.) Project Overview:
    Goals:- 
    a.) Develop a CPU scheduling algorithm that minimizes energy consumption while maintaining          system performance.
    b.) Ensure the algorithm is lightweight and suitable for mobile and embedded systems with 
        limited computational resources.
    c.) Optimize the algorithm to balance power efficiency and task execution speed.
    Expected Outcomes:-
    a.) A functional CPU scheduling algorithm that reduces energy consumption compared to               traditional scheduling algorithms (e.g., Round Robin, First-Come-First-Serve).
    b.) A simulation or prototype demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness in a mobile or 
        embedded system environment.
    c.) Metrics comparing energy consumption and performance (e.g., task completion time, CPU 
        utilization) with existing algorithms.
    Scope:-
    a.) Focus on single - core and multi - core CPU architecture commonly used in mobile and            embedded system.
    b.) Consider dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) and idle state management to 
        optimize energy usage.
    c.) Test the algorithm in simulated environments before deploying it on actual hardware.
