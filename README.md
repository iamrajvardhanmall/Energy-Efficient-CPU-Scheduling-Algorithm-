Execution Plan
1.) Run the C++ Scheduler:

  Compile and run the C++ code to test the EE-RR algorithm.

  Observe the energy consumption and task completion logs.

2.) Run the Python Simulation:

  Execute the Python simulation to emulate a mobile/embedded system.

  Collect energy consumption and performance metrics.

3.) Visualize Results:

  Use the Python visualization script to compare energy consumption and performance.

4.) Optimize:

  Refine the algorithm based on simulation results.

  Test with different workloads and hardware configurations.
